# McDonnell Douglas MD-88

# Custom Flight Surface Operations

#
# Elevator operations:
#
# The MD-80 series elevators are not typically directly controlled, but are 'flown' into position by
# operation of smaller control tabs along the trailing edge. These tabs are directly linked to the
# cockpit flight controls. As an effect, at low ground speeds there is not enough airflow for the
# elevators to be fully controlled. At rest, the elevators are free to move with the wind.
#
# To simulate this, elevator throw is reduced below a certain speed (currently 50 kts), and goes away
# altogether below a minimum speed (currently 20 kts). Currently below the minimum speed elevator position
# is neutralized, but in reality they take on odd positions, often up-elevator due to wind and balance
# considerations.
#
# Aileron operations:
#
# Like elevators, ailerons are also tab-controlled and have a similar animated functionality.
#
# Rudder operations:
#
# Rudders can be tab-controlled but are normally hydraulically actuated. There are no special
# rudder functions here.
#
# Slat operations:
#
# Slats are extended first, then flaps. Joshua Davidson has built a custom controller for this.
# 
#
# Spoiler operations:
#
# 3 sets of symmetrical spoilers
# flight spoilers (2 outboard treated as a single unit in the model)
# ground spoilers (1 inboard)
#
# General spoiler rules for MD-80 series:
#
# Flight spoilers perform aileron-assist when the aileron action exceeds 5 degrees deflection.
# Spoilers on the descending wing are activated.
# Spoilers deploy up to 30 degrees in flight mode.
# If spoilers are deployed, aileron-assist activity retracts spoilers on ascending side.
# In ground mode, spoilers deploy to a maximum of 60 degrees.
# Ground spoilers deploy only when there is weight on MLG (or NLG strut compression detected, not currently modeled)
# Speedbrake mode is locked-out when flaps are moved to 8 degrees or more (>11 degrees in the model)
# Lock-out is deactivated if flaps are retracted under 8 degrees or ground deployment conditions are met.
# Ground braking may be armed, in which case deployment is automatic when conditions are met.
#
# Currently the FDM has only one wing defined with one spoiler. Until I work out how to do separate wing
# sections in the FDM, this limitation required me to come up with a scheme to differentiate effects of
# the MD-88 having essentially two sets of spoilers. I do this by basing controls off a 'master' cockpit
# setting, and then dynamically modifying the actual 'spoilers' control based on the rules above. What
# this means is that spoiler effects are fairly light in the air, but massive on the ground.
